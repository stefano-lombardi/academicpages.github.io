## Empirical Monte Carlo Evidence on Estimation of Timing-of-Events Models

Joint work with Gerard J. van den Berg and Johan Vikström

<p align=”justify”>
The Timing-of-Events (ToE) model is a standard approach in dynamic treatment evaluation.
It provides a flexible competing risks setting where treatment and outcome hazard rates are jointly modelled
while allowing them to depend through correlated unobserved heterogeneity.
This paper adopts an Empirical Monte Carlo simulation approach to evaluate specification issues related to the estimation of ToE models.
We use Swedish unemployment spells and a rich set of background characteristics to simulate placebo treatment durations. 
Then we omit some of these characteristics when fitting ToE models, hence generating unobserved heterogeneity correlated across treatment and unemployment durations and based on real data. 
This simulation design is used to examine several specification issues. 
First, we examine the ToE performance under different types of unobserved heterogeneity, generated by omitting alternative blocks of covariates. 
Moreover, we compare different ways to select the number of mass points approximating the unobserved heterogeneity distribution. 
We also explore the specification of the baseline hazard and other implementation issues routinely encountered by reserchers when estimating ToE models.

## Comparing sequence data models: Prediction and dissimilarities

Joint work with Raffaella Piccarreta and Marco Bonetti

In this project we consider the case where information is available on different states experienced over time by a set of subjects, 
and we are interested in studying the resulting trajectories as a whole rather than the occurrence of specific events. 
Such situation commonly occurs in a variety of settings in social and biomedical studies. 
Model‐based approaches, such as multistate models or Hidden Markov models, are being increasingly used to analyze trajectories and to study their relationship with explanatory variables. 
The different assumptions underlying alternative models typically make the comparison of their predictive performance difficult. 
In this work we introduce a novel way to accomplish this task, based on microsimulation‐based predictions. 
By using simulaed data, we propose alternative criteria to evaluate a given model and/or to compare competing models with respect to their ability to generate trajectories similar to the observed ones.
