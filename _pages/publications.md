## Empirical Monte Carlo Evidence on Estimation of Timing-of-Events Models

Joint work with Gerard J. van den Berg and Johan Vikstr√∂m

The Timing-of-Events (ToE) model is a standard approach in dynamic treatment evaluation.
It provides a flexible competing risks setting where treatment and outcome hazard rates are jointly modelled
while allowing for their joint dependence through unobserved heterogeneity.
This paper adopts an Empirical Monte Carlo simulation approach to evaluate specification issues related to the estimation of ToE models.
We use Swedish unemployment spells and a rich set of background characteristics to simulate placebo treatment durations. 
Then we omit some of these characteristics when fitting ToE models, hence generating unobserved heterogeneity correlated across treatment and unemployment durations and based on real data. 
This simulation design is used to examine several specification issues. 
First, we examine the ToE performance under different types of unobserved heterogeneity, generated by omitting alternative blocks of covariates. 
Moreover, we compare different ways to select the number of mass points approximating the unobserved heterogeneity distribution. 
We also explore the specification of the baseline hazard and other implementation issues routinely encountered by reserchers when estimating ToE models.
