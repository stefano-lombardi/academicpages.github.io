During my studies I took an internationally recognized Academic Teacher Training Course.
+ Organizer: Division for Quality Enhancement, Academic Teaching and Learning
+ Extent: 5 weeks
+ Course description: download course information <span style="text-decoration:underline; color:blue"> [here](https://mp.uu.se/documents/432512/1088563/Course+information+Academic+Teacher+Training+Course-+ny+vt18.pdf/cb9bec63-bc17-b1a4-c17d-cc0ab9b26ca1) </span> 

In the past I have been responsible for teaching PhD-level exercise sessions.
My responsibilities included preparing problem sets (both theoretical and in programming), solve them in class, and correct and grade them.
